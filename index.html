  <h1>Hey, I'm Andreas.</h1>
  <p>I am a software developer and web enthusiast, currently based in Umeå, Sweden. I help enterprises operate more mobile @<a href="https://www.dataone.de" target="_blank">Data One</a> and learn to design for humans @<a href="https://www.umu.se" target="_blank">Umeå University</a>. Prior to that, I studied Applied Informatics @<a href="https://www.htwsaar.de" target="_blank">htwsaar</a>.</p>

  <p>When I'm not doing that, you will probably find me hacking away at my own projects, some of which are online on <a href="{{ social.github.url }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I also enjoy reading, traveling, running and being outside, and I share some of my memories on <a href="{{ social.instagram.url }}" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>

  <p>Let's talk! You're welcome to visit me on <a href="{{ social.linkedin.url }}" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, where you can also learn more about my education, work experience and professional qualifications. Or just drop me a <a class="mail-link" href="{{ social.mail.url }}">mail</a> – I would love to hear from you!</p>
